Traffic scheduling is one of the key technologies in smart city.
There exist three major shortcomings that plague researchers and developers:
1) There exist diverse traffic scheduling methods. It is beneficial to leverage cooperative vehicle-road scheduling to improve scheduling efficiency. However, due to the real-time interaction with a dynamic traffic environment, it’s difficult to integrate different kinds of scheduling methods rationally and comprehensively.
2) With the development of deep learning, it’s cost and complicated to implement state-of-the-art models.
3) It is hard to analyze the impact of coupled scheduling methods only depending on the microanalysis. By visualizing individual scheduling process and different performance metrics, it is more helpful to improve the traffic scheduling algorithms.
To fill in the above gaps, we design and implement a tool box towards urban traffic scheduling TSTB, based on the CityFlow simulation kernel and PyTorch. 
In TSTB, diverse traffic scheduling methods are integrated and microscope evaluation metrics and microscopic scheduling process is visualized.
