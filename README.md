Traffic scheduling is one of the key technologies in smart city.
There exist three major shortcomings that plague researchers and developers:
1) The method of traffic scheduling is diverse. Cooperative scheduling between vehicle-centric methods and road-centric methods is benefit for improving scheduling efficiency. However, due to the complexity of interaction with real-time dynamic traffic environment, it’s difficult to integrate different kinds of scheduling method reasonably and comprehensively.
2) With the development of deep learning, it’s cost and to complicated to implement the state-of-the-art models.
3) The impact of coupled scheduling method is hard to analyze only depending on the microanalysis while visualizing individual scheduling process and different performance metrics is more helpful to improve the traffic scheduling algorithms.
To fill in the above gaps, we design and implement a tool box towards urban traffic scheduling TSTB, based on the CityFlow simulation kernel and PyTorch. 
In TSTB, diverse traffic scheduling methods are integrated and microscope evaluation metrics and microscopic scheduling process is visualized.
